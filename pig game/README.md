in this game, two players start to compete with each other
the blue border shows whose turn is it
if it's your turn, you have to roll the dice until you get to your intended score
then you can hold your scores, be careful cause if your dice turn on number one all of your current holding will become zero and your turn will pass to your opponent.
so now you can understand why it's too risky to continue rolling the dice without  holding
each player who gets to 100 scores in total, wins the game.
